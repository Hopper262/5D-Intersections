=================

5-D Intersections is a plugin for [Weland](https://www.github.com/treellama/weland), a map editor for [Aleph One](https://github.com/Aleph-One-Marathon/alephone) and the Marathon series of games.

This plugin reports instances of "5-D space" in levels, where multiple polygons occupy the same volume of 3-D space.
